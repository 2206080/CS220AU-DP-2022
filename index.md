# The Existential Threat of Artificial Intelligence


##### Introduction: 

This article will critically evaluate the hypothesis suggesting that considerable progress in artifical intelligence (AI) technology will result in either human extinction or severely damage humanity or any wider damage to human society that may cause a recession. The article will also cover digital identities and analyse them utilizing David Whites' visitor and residents model whilst comparing it to the original natives versus immigrants notion of the internet and relate this to the advancement of AI and technology. Artificial intelligence refers to giving machines and human constructs the ability to simulate human intelligence, Standford Proffesso John McCarthy labelled this "the science and engineering of making intelligent machines." Though generally applied to computer systems, it is applicable to effectively all manmade machines.

What are some current uses of AI?
 AI is currently used across an exasperating variety of fields to automate certain processes and decrease cost whilst maintaining cost efficiency, examples of this include automated voice assistants on phone lines and computer systems that manage inventory or stocks. A morally debatable use of artifical intelligence includes advertising algorithims like that of youtube, tiktok or other social media as some research has discovered benefits like improved mood, better mental functioning and increased social support (Ellison et al. 2007, Myhre et al. 2017, Park et al. 2009, Patel et al.2015, Primack and Escobar-Viera 2017 cited from meta-analysis by Cunningham, S., Hudson, C.C. & Harkness). The problem with this kind of AI is that whilst not an overt direct existential threat, the isolation and increase in negative emotions can have an impact on people and long term lead compound with other issues cause a threat. More overt immorailty in AI usuage can be related to systems with more nefarious purposes may include malware that tracks your files or displays some threatening message, even worse would be automated targetting systems and the like for military weaponry, which whilst arguably necessary, will result in the lack of life.

 
Digital Identites:
Digital identities refers to our presence online and our use of the internet. Digital identities were initially seen as static, this was referred to as the natives and residents model (Mark Prensky, 2001). The general idea is that people from past generations would be immigrants to the internet, so they were believed to never be able to use it effectively, whilst the younger generations were viewed as natives that could quickly and efficiently traverse the internet. Soon it became apparent that this model is flawed as people were ineffective and utilising the internet for education in a productive manner. On the other hand, David White's Visitor and Residents model (V&R) is a fluid model utilizing a mapping process to allow individuals to map out their online activity that they can then analyse. It consists of a verticle and horizontal line. On the verticle line, on opposite ends, fit personal and institutional. Personal refers to uses of the internet where the aim is some sort of personal gain, be it a piece of information for your own knowledge, or communicating with friends. Contrastingly, institional uses of the internet refer to any use where the goal is achieving something for work or school. On the horizontal line visitors and residents is placed. The visitor end refers to employing the internet as a tool and using it to access or gain information without leaving a social trace, oon the other hand the residents end refers to  anything that can involve leaving a social trace for example sending emails, or interacting with posts or people on social media. An essay by Curiositry, introduces the idea that attention is the currency of the internet and portrays this as a system where people are farmed for their attention like animals, this supports the V&R model as it denotes the inefficient part of someones digital portfolio, specifically the personal resident portion on sites that are used to deliver an addictive dopamine rush which can lead to procrastination and inefficient use of time and the internet as a tool. For example in my portfolio below...

Analysis:

My V&R Map demonstrated that in the past I employed the internet for a bit of research for any homework/project I may have due, but it was primarily employed for entertainment and personal reasons. Right now, though having some extra additions like netflix in personal uses, it is more balanced with it's use being on university projects and researcg. In the future I hope to cut out the entertainment parts that are less relevant to me to make room for other things and to keep it primarily on work and institutional factors as social media and the sorts easily spiral out of control fairly quickly.
 
 
  
  How do existential threats link to AI?
  
  There was an aforementioned reference to do with the effects that excess use of the internet has on someones mental health, this is often induced by AI to trap users. This demonstrates that currently, AI is blending in with our normal use of the internet, this is somewhat consistent with David Clark that it will become a part of daily life and blend in with reality. Deepfakes are, videos and images that are altered in a manner that makes can emulate someones voice or imagery to demonstrate actions that never occured. A research article by Jiameng Pu. et al, (2020), would suggest deepfakes are not as dangerous as they may appear (refered to as Generative Adversarial Networks in the study). They achieve a 99.68% detection rate for deepfakes utilising "Noisescope," however, is it a reasonable expectation that every media outlet, pundit and individual would utilise the appropriate technology. A ficitonal example of AI affecting humanity is found in the theme of Cyberpunk which can be summarised as synthesis of lowlife and hightech, with technological advances such as AI and cybernetics juxtaposed against societal collapse. It is therefore arguable, and I would argue as true, that if with meld AI too deeply with our lives, for example as part of our body, it could cause a severe dystopian future. Afterall, criminals would gain access to abilities that allow them to cause more chaos and in turn military combat would become even more frightening and dangerous with computerized enhancements and body implants that would cause much more death and havoc due to increased destructiove capacity. The implants presented in Cybperpunk often incude the replacement of whole bodyparts or even inserting cybernetic parts that effect the mind, the big change in cyberpunk is that the more parts are linked to you the less human you become and the chances of you beicoming a "cyberpsycho" which is effectively summarised as a mindless beast that kills and destroys  anyone or thing which quite directly argues that we could become beasts should we lose ourselves to our desires. Thus we can argue that we become either less or more thanhuman, but would it still be accurate to call us humans. The theme this ellucidates is that a descending into "moral degeneracy" by abandoning what makes us humanan and give that ls us ce, is the core eads to our self destrution. Th alternate media  like walle approaches a similar theme of a loss of choice, though there are no bodily implants. Instead it features an AI that denies humans access to Earth and knowledge of it having life, albeit a single plant, to return to post- becoming uninhabitable for life, though that was its' original purpose and design, it does not allow people to beinformed and to over ride that decision instead attempting to make them wholly dependant on it as athe sole provider which insinuates a dangerous future despite the wholesome and happy ending. indication is that AI and normal life become one, and hence everybodiues visitor and residents map in this dystopianesque future becomes fully personal and fully institiutional in the residential sector as we are unable to prevent a melding of the two existence
