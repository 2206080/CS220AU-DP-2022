# AI as an existential threat and digital identities
##### Abstract
##### Introduction:
This article is critical investigates and engages in an evaluation of a potential existential threat in the form of artifical intelligence (AI), it is the hypothesis that suggests that continued advancements in AI technology can lead to unrecoverable damage or human exitinction, and will link the topic to digital identities, in particular the David Whites' Visitor and Residents model (V&R model) and compare it to the now outdated natives and immigrants model. The reason for the creation of this article is to bring awareness to this topic so that people are more conscious of the risks of AI but also so that people can potentially improve their time management skills.
This article will critically evaluate the hypothesis suggesting that considerable progress in artifical intelligence (AI) technology will result in either human extinction or severely damage humanity. The article will also cover digital identities and investigate them utilizing David Whites' visitor and residents model whilst comparing it to the original natives versus immigrants notion of the internet.
