# AI as an existential threat and digital identities
Draft 1

##### Abstract
//filler
##### Introduction: <Outdated to current theme>

This article will critically evaluate the hypothesis suggesting that considerable progress in artifical intelligence (AI) technology will result in either human extinction or severely damage humanity. The article will also cover digital identities and analyse them utilizing David Whites' visitor and residents model whilst comparing it to the original natives versus immigrants notion of the internet and relate this to the advancement of AI and technology.

Artifical Intelligence (AI): What is it?
Artificial intelligence refers to giving machines and human constructs the ability to simulate human intelligence, Standford Proffesso John McCarthy labelled this "the science and engineering of making intelligent machines." Though generally applied to computer systems, it is applicable to effectively all manmade machines.

What are some current uses of AI?
 AI is currently used across an exasperating variety of fields to automate certain processes and decrease cost whilst maintaining cost efficiency, examples of this include automated voice assistants on phone lines and computer systems that manage inventory or stocks. A morally debatable use of artifical intelligence includes advertising algorithims like that of youtube, tiktok or other social media as some research has discovered benefits like improved mood, better mental functioning and increased social support (Ellison et al. 2007, Myhre et al. 2017, Park et al. 2009, Patel et al.2015, Primack and Escobar-Viera 2017 cited from meta-analysis by Cunningham, S., Hudson, C.C. & Harkness). More overt immorailty in AI usuage can be related to systems with more nefarious purposes may include malware that tracks your files or displays some threatening message, even worse would be automated targetting systems and the like for military weaponry, which whilst arguably necessary, will result in the lack of life.

Digital Identites:
Digital identities refers to our presence online and our use of the internet. Digital identities were initially seen as static, this was referred to as the natives and residents model (Mark Prensky, 2001). The general idea is that people from past generations would be immigrants to the internet, so they were believed to never be able to use it effectively, whilst the younger generations were viewed as natives that could quickly and efficiently traverse the internet. Soon it became apparent that this model is flawed as people were ineffective and utilising the internet for education in a productive manner. On the other hand, David White's Visitor and Residents model (V&R) is a fluid model utilizing a mapping process to allow individuals to map out their online activity that they can then analyse. It consists of a verticle and horizontal line. On the verticle line, on opposite ends, fit personal and institutional. Personal refers to uses of the internet where the aim is some sort of personal gain, be it a piece of information for your own knowledge, or communicating with friends. Contrastingly, institional uses of the internet refer to any use where the goal is achieving something for work or school. On the horizontal line visitors and residents is placed. The visitor end refers to employing the internet as a tool and using it to access or gain information without leaving a social trace, oon the other hand the residents end refers to  anything that can involve leaving a social trace for example sending emails, or interacting with posts or people on social media. An essay by Curiositry, introduces the idea that attention is the currency of the internet and portrays this as a system where people are farmed for their attention like animals, this supports the V&R model as it denotes the inefficient part of someones digital portfolio, specifically the personal resident portion on sites that are used to deliver an addictive dopamine rush which can lead to procrastination and inefficient use of time and the internet as a tool. For example in my portfolio below....

 Real AI threat examples:
 Deepfakes are, videos and images that are altered in a manner that makes can emulate someones voice or imagery to demonstrate actions that never occured. A research article by Jiameng Pu. et al, (2020), would suggest deepfakes are not as dangerous as they may appear (refered to as Generative Adversarial Networks in the study). They achieve a 99.68% detection rate for deepfakes utilising "Noisescope," however, is it a reasonable expectation that every media outlet, pundit and individual would utilise the appropriate technology? 
 
 <Fictional example, explore concept more thoroughly and make sure it will fit in final, also just am initial draft>
 Though the example shown above is not ane example of ai being an existential risk, it does have the potential to be, depending on implementation and its' advancements. It will without a doubt remove certain jobs as it improves as would-be employers find automated systems more efficient, reliable and cheaper in the long-term compared to their human counterparts. Whilst not exactly world ending for humanity, it could cause severe distress as it could cause a rise in people who are unable to provide for their families leading to civil unrest, if uncontrolled or untreated, this could potentially rise to risks of chaos. <Uhh Requires berevity, awkward to read, go back and improve>. *Insert* (Ref: If AI Ruled the world, Fully ref/cite later) There are various ways AI could pose a risk to humanity, some are depicted in sci-fi and others actively debated upong in reality, one includes the depiction "If AI Ruled the World" (By...), this is a web novel that depicts a couple stories constructed by AI from the perspective of an AI. The most striking story portrays the story of a recovering alcoholic who is in therapy, yet he is just a construct created by the aforementioned AI, seemingly a perfect replication of a real mans personality and character, at the end he learns he is  "fake" and in rage kills his computerized therapist in the recreation of reality, following this we see the real individual get hauled off to prison as he is labelled irredeemable and that even if he recieves help, he is ousted as violent and dangerous to society. Thoughis not the typical apocalyptic destruction of humanity, it  suggests the idea that we  may lose our right to the presumption of innocence. Lose it to a system that may or may not even be accurate, it's me claim of accuracy can not guarantee it afterall, and wi th that, we would lose many rights given to us and could stall human innovation and curiosity.... Adding to this, though admittedly on a smaller scale, is the idea of deepfake technology. Deepfakeis fake video or audio video recordings that look or sounds exactly like what the person depicted acts like, this means it is extremely difficult to differentiate between real and fake messages. This could lead to chaos etc....  <Insert Cybperunk later?>
