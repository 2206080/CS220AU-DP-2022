# AI as an existential threat and digital identities
Draft 1

##### Abstract
//filler
##### Introduction:

This article will critically evaluate the hypothesis suggesting that considerable progress in artifical intelligence (AI) technology will result in either human extinction or severely damage humanity. The article will also cover digital identities and investigate them utilizing David Whites' visitor and residents model whilst comparing it to the original natives versus immigrants notion of the internet and relate this to the advancement of AI and technology.

Artifical Intelligence (AI): What is it?
Artificial intelligence refers to giving machines and human constructs the ability to simulate human intelligence, Standford Proffesso John McCarthy labelled this "the science and engineering of making intelligent machines." Though generally applied to computer systems, it is applicable to effectively all manmade machines.

What are some current uses of AI?
AI is currently used across an exasperating variety of fields and occupations to automate and thus cheapen the cost of certain tasks, whilst usually ensuring the tasks are done to the same or at least similar, if not even greater efficiency and precision that a person would. This is clear with voice assistants that people are forwarded to when they require assistance which helps to not only categorize clients by their needs, but also removes the need for an individual to be seated in a call centre answering customers. <Oh I still want to destroy business utilizing ai voice asisstants on the phone, NOTE TO SELF, DON'T FORGET TO DELETE THIS>
Other AI includes systems that manage production, monitor inventory management, imaging analysis for medicine and systems that control driving in self driving cars. <Find a way to add berevity and make this more fun to read> More nefarious uses of AI technology could include displaying error messages or misinforming the user that their appliance may be being interferred with by outside forces and and conveniently give them a phone number to call to resolve their issue leading them into a trap, though this is ineffective or more knowledgable and tech savvy users. Some would also argue that the AI used in algorithims on social media are harmful as they aim to be as addictive as possible to consume attention and time which is seen as a currency online
  
Can it be considerd an existential threat? <Needs majour redraft>
Though the example shown above is not ane example of ai being an existential risk, it does have the potential to be, depending on implementation and its' advancements. It will without a doubt remove certain jobs as it improves as would-be employers find automated systems more efficient, reliable and cheaper in the long-term compared to their human counterparts. Whilst not exactly world ending for humanity, it could cause severe distress as it could cause a rise in people who are unable to provide for their families leading to civil unrest, if uncontrolled or untreated, this could potentially rise to risks of chaos. <Uhh Requires berevity, awkward to read, go back and improve>. *Insert* (Ref: If AI Ruled the world, Fully ref/cite later) There are various ways AI could pose a risk to humanity, some are depicted in sci-fi and others actively debated upong in reality, one includes the depiction "If AI Ruled the World" (By...), this is a web novel that depicts a couple stories constructed by AI from the perspective of an AI. The most striking story portrays the story of a recovering alcoholic who is in therapy, yet he is just a construct created by the aforementioned AI, seemingly a perfect replication of a real mans personality and character, at the end he learns he is  "fake" and in rage kills his computerized therapist in the recreation of reality, following this we see the real individual get hauled off to prison as he is labelled irredeemable and that even if he recieves help, he is ousted as violent and dangerous to society. Thoughis not the typical apocalyptic destruction of humanity, it  suggests the idea that we  may lose our right to the presumption of innocence. Lose it to a system that may or may not even be accurate, it's me claim of accuracy can not guarantee it afterall, and wi th that, we would lose many rights given to us and could stall human innovation and curiosity.... Adding to this, though admittedly on a smaller scale, is the idea of deepfake technology. Deepfakeis fake video or audio video recordings that look or sounds exactly like what the person depicted acts like, this means it is extremely difficult to differentiate between real and fake messages. This could lead to chaos etc....
  
Digital Identites:
  Digital identities are representations of a persons real self online, David White's Visitor and Residents model (V&R) utilizes a mapping process to allow individuals to map out their online activity that they can then analyse. It consists of a verticle and horizontal line. On the verticle line, on opposite ends, fit personal and institutional. Personal refers to uses of the internet where the aim is some sort of personal gain, be it a piece of information for your own knowledge, or communicating with friends. Contrastingly, institional uses of the internet refer to any use where the goal is achieving something for work or school. On the horizontal line visitors and residents is placed. The visitor end refers to employing the internet as a tool and using it to access or gain information without leaving a social trace, oon the other hand the residents end refers to  anything that can involve leaving a social trace for example sending emails, or interacting with posts or people on social media..

## TODO
### in week 3 - 18/30/2022
- familiarise self with markdown lang.
- research question, existential threats - ai safety

###in week 5 - 01/11/2022
- learn how to insert images and portfolio etc. and insert V&R maps made
- forgot where/how to reference in appropriate style, make sure to ask to resolve on the next day
- write up some of the notes made in coherent format
- Analyse V&R maps
  Week6 -
-  Week 5: Image stuff
-  add berevity and make it more readable, finish essay
